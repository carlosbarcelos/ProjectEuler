# Project Euler
The solutions to the problems from [Project Euler](https://projecteuler.net).

## Problem Solutions
Solution files are numbered according to the problem ID in the Project Euler [archive](https://projecteuler.net/archives).

Run them with `{ProblemNumber}.py`

## Test Solutions
There is a test harness to help confirm that the answer to any given solution is correct.

Run `test.py` to test all Python solutions for the correct answer specified in [answers.csv](answers.csv).

## Generate Templates
Creating templates for each and every problem was tedious. BeautifulSoup makes it easier by automatically pulling problem information from ProjectEuler.net and generating solution templates programatically.

Run `GenerateTemplates.py` to automatically generate solution templates for missing solutions in their own *Templates/* folder.
